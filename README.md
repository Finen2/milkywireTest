## Code and Structure

When it comes to code and structure there are inspired by strategy pattern and object oriented program, witch is the base to separate the components, sass, request and functionality files to able to expand the project and to be able to write most of the code only once, an example of that is the URL file that contains the URL that is used on all requests. When it comes to sass files there  the code is based on a modified version on BEM (Block, Element,  Modifier) in combination to centralise the universal variables.
The goal with the structure of the code and how it is divide to different files is ment to make it easier to expand and understand the code.


## Choose of technology
```python
The technologies that I have chosen are:
Vue
Typescript
Sass
Bootstrap
Axios
```
The choices of technologies was made many based on one of two reasons. The first reason is ease of use, and both Vue, SASS and Bootstrap are chosen for manly this reason. The second reason is manly what I prefer to use, in this case for Axios instead of fetch and Typescript instead of Javascript, and the Choice to use Vue is based also partly on how easy it is to integrate with typescript.

## What would I do different

There are a number of thing I would do different if I would redo the assignment. For example I would create an mocup with Figma or adobe XD to pin down ideas and a design to later code. When it comes to the code I would liked to not used Bootstrap witch in this project seemed to be in the way and either use material design or if I would have more time create the components in question for more control.

## What would I do more if I had more time
If I had more time I would add five things:
The first this is to either add an Pagination to show a set amount of post at a time, or functionality that is simmular to what Facebook have done that load a limited number of posts and when the user has scrolled to the bottom it loads a new set of posts that is added to the page and been shown after the first loaded posts.
The second this is to add a component that would allow to add new posts based on an specific user.
The third addition that I would add is a function that would add todays date to the editing of a post that is the date when edited.
The fourth thing that I would add some way to sort the posts by criteria, either be search or by having listing.
As the fifth this I would do different would be how the error handling was done, I would have triggers some kind of error message instead of returning the error.

## Tradeoffs
There the tradeoff that with the result, the main one being that rendering the posts could be a problem based on cher number of posts that are loded initially. An other trade-off that was made is that even though the site is made to be responsive it is not fully specially for smaller screens that are in landscape orientation due to some of the pictures being horizontal witch means that the image could be fully seen. The error handling as is could be better specially what was done with the error data.
